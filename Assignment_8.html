<h1>Assignment 8 Instructions</h1>

Assignment 8 is here <br>
We are now testing our “testing skills” and because we have learned how to use JDBC , <br>
feel free to implement persistent memory in your applications , if you do you get 10 marks of bonus.<br>
Remember , if there is anything here that you do not quite understand,please ask me , anything at all :) <br>

<h2>Question 1</h2>
Write all the test of your project so far .<br>
You need to write them and attach a PDF document which shows the description of the text and its status,
whether it failed, or passed.<br>
If you had an error you need to mention which one, and do this in a table, with the following columns: <br>
Test number, description, test data, Test status(fail, or pass)
and error (which contains the error that happened if any or "no error", if no error occurred).<br>

<h3>Grading Rubric</h3>
This question is worth 50 marks <br>
If all the tests pass, that is 40, if you document it well that is 10 <br>
If a test fails, that is -2, and if a test is not documented, that is -1 <br>

<h2>Question 2</h2>
Do the graphical user interface of all the screens that you are going to need for your project.<br>
You do not need to include event handling, but if you can include that, please feel free to do so. <br>
Apart from the code, you will submit a document with a list of all the screens, or the the user interfaces
that your project has, and the classes that do that in your code.<br>
The document will also contain screenshots of all the screens that you have done. <br>

<h3>Grading Rubric</h3>
This question is worth 50 marks<br>
Having all the screens done, that is worth 40 marks <br>
Having all the screens well documented that is 10 marks.<br>
If there is a screen that is missing, that is -5 <br>
If there is a screen that is not documented
(the name of the class, and the screen photo as well as what that screen does ) that is -2 <br>

<h3>Attention</h3>
Here are a few things that can make you loose marks, please make sure that you note these things well :)<br>
If there is no author on the top of every page, that is -2, for every page that does not have an author on the top. <br>
If your read me does not describe in short what your project does, and does not have the names of people in the group,
that is -5<br>
Remember to keep your code, well organized, well commented and clean.<br><br>

Go my African Giants, go get these hundreds, and remember to be safe :)<br>
<h3>Have fun :)</h3>>
